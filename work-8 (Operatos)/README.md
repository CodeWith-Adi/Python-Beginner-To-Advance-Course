# What are Operators ?
Operators are special symbols used to perform specific operations on data. They are used to manipulate and transform data, and to control the flow of a program's execution.

# Types of operators in python:
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparision Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assingment Operators

## Arithmetic Operatots ? 
Arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform methmatical operations on numbers, such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. They are used to manipulate numerical values and perform calculations in programming languages, including python.

## Types of Arithmetic operators:

### Addition:
`(a + b)` returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
```python
a = 2
b = 7
print(a + b)
# Output: 7
```
### Substraction:
`(a - b)` returns the difference of `a` and `b`.
```python
a = 10
b = 7
print(a - b)
# Output: 3
```
### Multiplication:
`(a * b)` returns the product of `a` and `b`.
```python
a = 4
b = 7
print(a * b)
# Output: 28
```
### Division:
`(a / b)` returns the quotient of `a` by `b`.
```python
a = 14
b = 7
print(a / b)
# Output: 2
```
### Floor Division:
`(a // b)` returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the quotient of `a` and `b`.
```python
a = 17
b = 5
print(a // b)
# Output: 3
```
### Modules:
`(a % b)` returns the remainder of division of `a` by `b`.
```python
a = 15
b = 7
print(a % b)
# Output: 1
```
### Exponent:
`(a ** b)` returns `a` raised to the power of `b`.
```python
a = 3
b = 2
print(a ** b)
# Output: 9
```

## Comparison Operators:

A symbol used to compare values, expression, or variables, and return a boolean result `(True or False)`.

### Types of comparision operators:

### Equal (==): Returns True if both values are equal.
Example:
```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a == b)
# Output : True
```

### Not equal (!=): Returns True if values are not equal.
Example:
```python
a = 6
b = 4
print(a != b)
# Output : True
```

### Greater Than (>): Return True if first value is greater than secound value.

Example:
```python:
a = 7
b = 8
print(a > b)
# Output : True
```

### Less Than (<): Return True if first value is less than secound value.

Example:
```python
a = 4
b = 2
print(a < b)
# Output : True
```

### Greater Than or Equal (>=):Returns True if the first value is greater than or equal to secound value.

Example:
```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a >= b)
# Output : True
```

### Less than or Equal(<=): Returns if the first valuae is less than or equal to secound value

Example:
```python
a = 1
b = 4
print(a <= b)
# Output : True
```

## Logical Operators:
Logical operators are Special Symbols combinning conditional statements to produce a boolean result.

### Logical And (and):
Returns True if both conditions arfe true.
Example:
```python
a = 5
b = 3
print(a > b and b < a)
# Output : True
```

### Logical Or (or):
Return True if at least one condition is true.

Example:
```python
a = 3 
b = 5
print(a < b or b < a)
# Output : Ture
```

### Logical Not (not):
Returns True if the condition is false, and vice versa.

Example :
```python
a = 5
print(not a > 7)
# Output : True
```

## Assingment Operators:
Assingment operators are used to assign a value to variable. They are a shorthand way to perform operations and then assing the result to the variable.

## Types of assingment operators:
### Assingment (=): Assings the value on the right to the variable on left.

Example:
```python
a = 5
print(a)
# Output : 5
```

### Addition Assingment (+=): Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left.

Example:
```python
a = 5
a += 2
print(a)
# Output : 7
```

### Substraction Assingment (-=): Substracts the value on the right to the value on the left.

Example:
```python
a = 5
a -= 2
print (a)
# Output : 3
```

### Multiplication Assingment (*=): Multiplies the variable on the left to the value on the right.
Example: 
```python
a = 5
a *= 2
print(a)
# Output : 10
```

### Division Assingment (/=): Divides the variable on the right to the variable on the left by the value of right.
Example:
```python
a = 5
a /= 2
print(a)
# Output : 2.5
```

### Floor Division Assingment (//=): Performs floor division of the variable to the left by the value on the right.
Example:
```python
a = 5
a //= 2
print(a)
# Output = 2
```

### Modules Assingment (%=): Assings the remainder of the division of the variable on the left by the value on the right.
Example:
```python
a = 5
a %= 2
print(a)
# Output : 1
```

### Exponentiation Assingnment (**=): Raises the variable on the left to the power of the value on the right.
Example:
```python
a = 5
a **= 2
print(a)
# Output : 25
```
