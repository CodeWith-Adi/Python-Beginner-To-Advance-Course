# Print üñ®Ô∏è
The `print()` function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device. The message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.

# Comments üí¨
Comments in Python are the inclusion of short descriptions along with the code to increase its readability. A developer uses them to write his or her thought process while writing the code. It explains the basic logic behind why a particular line of code was written.

# Escape sequences üî°
Escape sequences allow you to include special characters in strings. To do this, simply add a backslash ( \ ) before the character you want to escape. For example:
```python
print("Hello\nThis should be printed in next line")  # Newline
print("Hello\fThis should be printed in next line")  # Formfeed
print("Hello\vThis should be printed in next line")  # Vertical tab
print("Hello\tThis should be printed in next line")  # Horizontal tab
print("Alert!\a")  # Bell/Alert
print("Hello\b Adi")  # Backspace
print("Hello\rAdi")  # Carriage return
print("Adi says : \"Hello World!\"")  # Double quote
print('This is CodeWithAdi\'s video')  # Single quote
# print this "Hello \ Adi" # HomeWork
```
